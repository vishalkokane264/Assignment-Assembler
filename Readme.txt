Files that require to run program:
	My_opcode
	MyRegister
	createlst.h
	conversionFunction.h
Output files that generated by program:
	file.Error
	file.Interm
	file.Objcode
	file.Symbol

*I have written program of assembler that convert assembly program in
intermediate code through pass1 assembler and create lst file 

*the whole program divided into 3 parts
1)section data
2)section bss
3)section text

-->
first of all i have open the assembly file in read mode and fetch the record line by line till we reach to eof.
then record split into 3 groups

if any section found it gets validated and then enter into function 
1]section .data
	in this section symbols,datatype,and data get separated and store into structure symtab

if 2nd entry dd,db,dq then data gets sorted accordingly into symbol table and data append into intermediate file

2] section .bss
	if 2nd entry resd,resb,resq,resw then data gets sorted accordingly into symbol table and data append into intermediate file

3]section text
	In this I separated opcode, oprand1, oprand2 and check for oprands in symtable and regtable and populate entries in ___.i file
	separate out labels also

4] run assembler.c file using
	->gcc finalassembler.c
	->./a.out Testfile.asm
5] after executing assembler.c file the following files should be created in "Output" directory
	->file.error
	->file.interm
	->file.litral
	->file.objcode
	->file.symbol

6] After successful end from pass2 the file.Objcode will pass to smac0 simulator that executes the file.Objcode file and give appropriate result

*********************************************
7] Remaining things to do 
	-->Macro expansion
	-->Smac0 simulator
Since macro assembler is not working properly I have not send it and same for Smac0 simulator..
